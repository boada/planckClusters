- TOTAL THROUGHPUT CURVES (OTA+ACS)
- Calculated on June,12 2003 using the following component  tables:

 WFC: refdata.cmptbl="mysynphot$wfc120603_tmc.fits"
 HRC: refdata.cmptbl="mysynphot$hrc120603_tmc.fits"

 where mysynphot is /home/sirianni/SYNPHOT/REFFILES/

in particuar, the difference from the current version of SYNPHOT are:
 
dqehrc120603.asc  - dqe for HRC calculated from G.De Marchi using the two standar stars observed so far.
dqewfc120603.asc  - dqe for WFC calculated from G.De Marchi using the two standar stars observed so far.

some filters have been excluded in the fitting routine and have been corrected manually
by multiplying the throughput by a constant:
 
Filter   WFC     HRC     AVG
------  -----   -----   ------
F475W   0.993   1.017   1.0050
F502N   0.985   0.996   0.9905
F550M   0.967   0.987   0.9770
F606W   0.984   0.983   0.9835
F658N   0.986   0.978   0.9820
F660N   0.998   0.972   0.9850
F892N   0.971   1.016   0.9935

==========================================

Summary for TXITXO:

TOTAL THROUGHPUT CURVES (OTA+ACS)  Calculated on June,12 2003
- CCD DQE provided by G.De Marchi on June 2 2003
- Some filters have been modified manually (F475W,F502N,F550M,F606W,F658N,F660N, F892N)
  because they could not be included in the correction for the DQE.
- for  more detail see /home/sirianni/SYNPHOT/REFFILES/X_MODELS/061203/README
- Note: for HRC we expect future corrections up to 12% in  red filters
-       for WFC up to 3-4 % for F850LP, < 2% for all the other broad band filters.
