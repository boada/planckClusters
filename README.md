# On the Trail of the Most Massive Galaxy Clusters in the Universe

This is all of the source code for the papers associated with the Planck cluster follow up project. Papers include:

- [High Confidence Optical Confirmation of High Signal-to-Noise Planck Cluster                       Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06378)

Here is the basic structure of the repo.

- catalogs -- original PSZ catalogs
- cluster_search -- my searches for clusters
- data -- all of the original imaging associated with the project
- legacy -- old code I didn't want to throw away
- MOSAICpipe -- the main pipeline to process all of the MOSAIC1/2 and NEWFIRM data
- observing -- scripts to help with the observing
- papers -- papers from other people who have done similar work
- plots -- script to make (some of) the plots for the paper
- results -- results from everyone's cluster finding
- scripts -- misc. utility scripts, a catchall.
- sims -- simulations to understand the depth of the imaging
- snippets -- snippets of code that I found useful.
